                        You are being invited to take part in a research project. Before you decide whether or not to
                        participate, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it
                        will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with
                        others if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more
                        information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part. Thank you for reading
                        this.

                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">What is the project's purpose?</h2>
                    <p>This research aims to understand how NHS and health and care organisations are developing their
                        research capacity and capability, particularly in nursing, midwifery, and allied health
                        professions. The SORT survey collects information about your organisation's readiness to support
                        research activities.</p>
                    <p>The research will contribute to understanding the organisational factors that support research
                        capability development. Findings will help organisations and system leaders identify best
                        practice approaches and areas for improvement to build research capacity across the NHS and
                        health and care system.</p>
                    <p>This is an independent research project conducted by <a

                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Why have I been chosen?</h2>
                    <p>You have been chosen because you work at an organisation participating in this research. Your
                        perspective on your organisation's research capacity and support is valuable for this study. We
                        are aiming to gather responses from a range of staff across all participating organisations.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Do I have to take part?</h2>
                    <p>It is entirely up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you do decide to take part,
                        keep this information sheet for your records.</p>
                    <p>Participation is voluntary and there will be no negative consequences if you do not wish to take
                        part. You may also skip any individual questions in the survey that you prefer not to
                        answer.</p>
                    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
                        <p>⚠️ Once you have submitted the survey, you will not be able to withdraw your response. This
                            is because the survey is anonymous and your individual responses cannot be identified or
                            retrieved after submission.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Please note that by choosing to participate in this research, this will not create a legally
                        binding agreement, nor is it intended to create an employment relationship between you and the
                        University of Sheffield.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">What will happen if I take part? What do I have to do?</h2>
                    <p>If you decide to participate, you will complete an online survey that will take approximately
                        <strong>15-20 minutes</strong> to complete.</p>
                    <p>The survey asks questions about:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your professional role and background</li>
                        <li>Your organisation's research infrastructure and support systems</li>
                        <li>Your assessment of your organisation's research readiness</li>
                        <li>Your views on barriers and facilitators to research activity</li>
                        <li>Demographic information (such as professional role, qualification level, gender, age, and
                            ethnic origin)
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You will access the survey via an anonymous form link. The link does not collect any information
                        that could identify you. You can complete the survey at a time that suits you and submit it when
                        ready.</p>
                    <p>There are no travel expenses or other costs associated with participation.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</h2>
                    <p>The survey asks questions about your organisation's research capacity. There are minimal risks
                        associated with participation. However, if you have concerns:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your responses are completely anonymous and cannot be traced back to you</li>
                        <li>Individual responses will never be reported or identified</li>
                        <li>All feedback is presented at aggregate level only, across all participating organisations
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr>
                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h2>
                    <p>There are no direct personal benefits to you from participating in this research. However, this
                        research will contribute to understanding how to build research capacity across the NHS and
                        health and care system. The findings may help improve support for research in your organisation
                        and across health and care services, which may benefit healthcare professionals and the
                        communities they serve.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Will my taking part in this project be kept confidential?</h2>
                    <p>Your responses are <strong>completely anonymous</strong>. We do not collect your name, email
                        address, job title, or any other directly identifying information.</p>
                    <p>The survey form is distributed anonymously, and there is no mechanism for linking your responses
                        back to you or your organisation. Your identity will be protected at all stages of the
                        research.</p>
                    <p>All information collected will be kept strictly confidential and will only be accessible to
                        members of the research team. You will not be able to be identified in any reports,
                        publications, or feedback to your organisation.</p>
                    <p>Because your data is genuinely anonymous, we cannot and will not attempt to re-identify you, even
                        if you later request withdrawal or changes to your responses after submission.</p>

                    <p>We are required by data protection legislation to inform you that the legal basis for processing
                        personal data collected in this research is that &quot;processing is necessary for the

                        General Data Protection Regulation).</p>
                    <p>Because this survey is anonymous, your responses do not constitute personal data and are
                        therefore not subject to data protection rights such as access or deletion requests. However, we
                        treat your information with the same standards of security and confidentiality as we would for
                        identifiable data.</p>
                    <p>The demographic information we collect (including ethnic origin) is collected on an anonymous
                        basis only. We are applying this collection under the condition that the use of your data is
                        necessary 'for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research purposes or
                        statistical purposes' (Article 9(2)(j) of the UK General Data Protection Regulation).</p>
