            <h2>🧱 NHS Network and Firewall Issues</h2>

            <p>
                If you are experiencing difficulties accessing the SORT online tool from an NHS device or network,
                this may be due to security measures and firewall restrictions implemented by your NHS organisation.
                The NHS has strict security policies in place that often block or restrict access to external web applications.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 1: Verify the Issue</h3>

            <div>
                <p><strong>Test from a non-NHS device:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Try logging into the SORT tool from a personal device (e.g., home computer, mobile phone) or a private browser session using your NHS login credentials.</li>
                    <li>If login works successfully on the non-NHS device, proceed to test on your NHS machine.</li>
                    <li>If you experience issues on your NHS machine but not on your personal device, this confirms the issue is related to your NHS organisation's network restrictions.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Contact NHS IT Support</h3>

            <div>
                <p>
                    If the tool works on a non-NHS device but not on your NHS machine, you will need to log a support ticket
                    with your local NHS organisation's IT department.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When raising the ticket, explain that you need access to the SORT online tool for research purposes
                    and that the issue appears to be caused by network restrictions or firewall rules.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Requesting Firewall Exemptions</h3>

            <div>
                <p>
                    Your NHS IT department will need to troubleshoot the connectivity issue. If the problem is confirmed
                    to be firewall-related, your IT team will need to go through an NHS risk assessment process before
                    making any firewall changes.
                </p>

                <p><strong>When contacting your NHS IT support, provide the following information:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The URL of the SORT tool that you're trying to access</li>
                    <li>The purpose: Research tool for systematic reviews</li>
                    <li>The specific error messages or behaviour you're experiencing</li>
                    <li>Confirmation that the tool works from non-NHS networks</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Sample ticket description:</strong></p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p>
                        "I am conducting research using the SORT online tool https://app.sort-online.org/. The tool works successfully
                        when accessed from my personal device but fails to connect from my NHS workstation. This appears
                        to be a firewall or network restriction issue. Could you please investigate and, if necessary,
                        request a firewall exemption through the appropriate risk assessment process? This tool is essential
                        for our research project."
                    </p>
                </blockquote>
            </div>

            <h3>Step 4: If Firewall Changes Cannot Be Made</h3>

            <div>
                <p>
                    In some cases, your NHS organisation may not be able or willing to modify firewall rules, even after
                    a risk assessment. This decision is typically based on local security policies and risk management frameworks.
                </p>
                <p><strong>If this occurs, consider the following workarounds:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use a non-NHS device:</strong> Access the SORT tool from a personal computer or device when working remotely or outside of the NHS network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile access:</strong> Use your mobile phone with cellular data (not NHS Wi-Fi) to access the tool.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scheduled access times:</strong> Dedicate specific times to work on the SORT tool from a non-NHS device.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discuss with your research team:</strong> This may impact your research timeline and workflow. Inform your research supervisor or team lead about the access limitations so alternative arrangements can be made.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Understanding the Process</h3>

            <p>
                NHS organisations implement strict security measures to protect sensitive patient data and comply with
                information governance requirements. While these measures are essential for security, they can sometimes
                restrict access to legitimate research tools.
            </p>

            <p>
                The process of requesting firewall exemptions typically involves:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Security risk assessment by the NHS IT security team</li>
                <li>Review by information governance officers</li>
                <li>Approval from relevant management or security committees</li>
                <li>Implementation and testing by network administrators</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This process can take several days to weeks, depending on your organisation's procedures.
            </p>
