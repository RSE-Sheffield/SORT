                    <p><strong>1.1</strong> The Provider Organisation wishes to use the SORT Online platform ("<strong>the Platform</strong>") to conduct self-assessment of organisational research readiness using the Self-Assessment of Organisational Readiness Tool (SORT).</p>

                    <p><strong>1.2</strong> The Platform is hosted and maintained by the Recipient Institution and enables organisations to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collect survey responses from healthcare professionals about research readiness</li>
                        <li>Generate organisational reports and improvement plans</li>
                        <li>Contribute anonymised data to longitudinal research on research capacity development</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>1.3</strong> This Agreement governs the sharing of data collected via the Platform between the Provider Organisation and the Recipient Institution for the dual purposes of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Organisational use:</strong> enabling the Provider Organisation to assess and improve its research capacity</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>1.4</strong> The research is conducted under ethics approval and aims to build a national evidence base on research capacity in nursing, midwifery, and allied health professions over a 10-year period.</p>
