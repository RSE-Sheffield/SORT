# SORT
### Self-Assessment of Organisational Readiness Tool


The SORT provides a comprehensive self-assessment framework, enabling organisations to evaluate and strengthen their research capabilities within nursing and 
broader health and care practices. By guiding you through forty-four targeted statements, SORT helps assess your current level of research maturity 
and the support available for nurses involved in research. Upon completion, your organisation will be equipped to create a tailored improvement plan to better 
integrate research into nursing practice, ultimately contributing to improved patient care.
