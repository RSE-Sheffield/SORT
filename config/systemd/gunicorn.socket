Description=gunicorn socket

[Socket]
ListenStream=/run/gunicorn.sock
# Our service won't need permissions for the socket, since it
# inherits the file descriptor by socket activation.
# Only the nginx daemon will need access to the socket:
SocketUser=www-data
SocketGroup=www-data
# Once the user/group is correct, restrict the permissions:
SocketMode=0660
